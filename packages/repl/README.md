To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Using a different package manager is likely fine, too.

```shell
npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install
```

To open the REPL in your browser, run

```bash
bun run dev
```

Here too, using a different package manager is likely fine.

```shell
npm run dev
# or
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn run dev
```
