**unocss-preset-css** is a front-end tool which unlocks writing something very close to vanilla CSS directly in the `class` attribute. Style any element from any other element, styling `::before` and `::after` directly on their originating element, and using CSS at-rules without breaking to a `<style>` tag, all without learning new syntax.

It's like Tailwind CSS, or Windi CSS, or any other CSS DOM API, but with the minimum of tool-specific idioms.

Want `{ color: currentColor }`? That's `class="{color:currentColor}"`, not `class="text-current"`".

Want `{ line-height: 2 }`? That's `class="{line-height:2}"`, not `class="leading-loose"`.

## Who is unocss-preset-css for?

- Adventurous fans of writing CSS via a `class` DOM API interested in trying out patterns other than Tailwind's, in the search for the next evolutionary step.
- People wondering what UnoCSS is all about. [^1]
- People who like or are at least intrigued by the idea of writing CSS via a `class` attribute DOM API but are turned off by Tailwind's (and then Windi's) inconsistent and overloaded renaming of CSS properties.
- People who don't have to try Tailwind to know that they hate it but wouldn't mind something new to casually bad mouth, probably.
